# Hello World! I'm Marc Violides 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Data Science Master's student at the University of Edinburgh, fascinated by all the ways data can reveal insights, drive decision-making, and even predict the future! 

I'm currently honing my skills in the vast and exciting world of cloud technologies, specifically focusing on earning AWS Cloud Certificates. In a world increasingly dominated by digital data, I believe cloud technologies will hold a pivotal role, offering scalable and secure solutions for storing and analyzing the gigantic data sets that modern industries work with.

💻 **What I'm Working On**: Data Science | Machine Learning | AWS Cloud 

If you're interested in collaborating on a project, want to share some cool insights, or have any suggestions on how I can improve my work, don't hesitate to get in touch! I'm always eager to learn from others and enhance my skills in any way possible.

🌏 **Collaborations**: Open to opportunities, let's make data speak!
